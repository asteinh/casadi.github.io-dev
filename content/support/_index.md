# Support

## Community
If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add, the simplest thing is simply to write to the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/casadi-users). We read the forum post regularly and try to respond as soon as possible. The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you [cite us](../about#citing), whenever you use CasADi in scientific work.

## Academic cooperation
If you want more help, we are always open for *academic* cooperation. An academic cooperation usually take the form of a co-authorship of a journal paper. Please contact us directly if you are interested in this.

## Professional cooperation
Both main developers offer professional CasADi-related consulting (e.g. teaching, problem solving, adding features).
